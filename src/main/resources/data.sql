Unlike many other frameworks, which focus on only one area, Spring framework provides a wide verity of features addressing the modern business needs via its portfolio projects.</br>Spring framework provides flexibility to configure beans in multiple ways such as XML, Annotations, and JavaConfig. With the number of features increased the complexity also gets increased and configuring Spring applications becomes tedious and error-prone.</br></br>The Spring team created SpringBoot to address the complexity of configuration.</br></br>But before diving into SpringBoot, we will take a quick look at the Spring framework and see what kind of problems SpringBoot is trying to address.</br></br><b>In this article we will cover:</b></br></br><ol><li>Overview of Spring framework</li><li>A web application using Spring MVC and JPA(Hibernate)</li><li>A quick taste of SpringBoot</li></ol>',1,'2017-12-21',1);
insert into posts(id, title, content,category_id, created_on,created_by) values (2,'Spring','Spring came into being in 2003 as a response to the complexity of the early J2EE specifications. While some consider Java EE and Spring to be in competition, Spring is, in fact, complementary to Java EE. The Spring programming model does not embrace the Java EE platform specification; rather, it integrates with carefully selected individual specifications from the EE umbrella:</br><ol><li>Servlet API (JSR 340)</li><li>WebSocket API (JSR 356)</li><li>Concurrency Utilities (JSR 236)</li><li>JSON Binding API (JSR 367)</li><li>Bean Validation (JSR 303)</li><li>JPA (JSR 338)</li><li>JMS (JSR 914)</li></ol></br>as well as JTA/JCA setups for transaction coordination, if necessary.</br>The Spring Framework also supports the Dependency Injection (JSR 330) and Common Annotations (JSR 250) specifications, which application developers may choose to use instead of the Spring-specific mechanisms provided by the Spring Framework.</br>As of Spring Framework 5.0, Spring requires the Java EE 7 level (e.g. Servlet 3.1+, JPA 2.1+) as a minimum - while at the same time providing out-of-the-box integration with newer APIs at the Java EE 8 level (e.g. Servlet 4.0, JSON Binding API) when encountered at runtime. This keeps Spring fully compatible with e.g. Tomcat 8 and 9, WebSphere 9, and JBoss EAP 7.</br></br>Over time, the role of Java EE in application development has evolved. In the early days of Java EE and Spring, applications were created to be deployed to an application server. Today, with the help of Spring Boot, applications are created in a devops- and cloud-friendly way, with the Servlet container embedded and trivial to change. As of Spring Framework 5, a WebFlux application does not even use the Servlet API directly and can run on servers (such as Netty) that are not Servlet containers.',2,'2017-12-22',2);
